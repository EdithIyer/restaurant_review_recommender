The dishes recall memories of island taco stands, while plates arrive stacked high with buttermilk fried chicken, pastor with roasted cauliflower, and pork belly with tomato escabeche and poblano sweet and sour. The daily roster of frozen drinks is equally fun and always full of rum, mezcal, fresh fruit, and the occasional splash of fernet, just as it should be."},{"name":"Misfit Snackbar","cost":2,"address":"\n3401 E Colfax Ave\nDenver, CO 80206\n201-679-\u200b7079\n","cuisine":"Bar Food","review":"Served from a small window attached to a barely closet-sized kitchen in the corner of a City Park cocktail bar, Misfit Snackbar has quickly become an all-day hub for its almost psychedelic interpretations of dishes from across the globe. The menu is constantly changing, with plates like hamachi crudo being revamped with sweet pea and lemon curd, pickled fresnos, soy pickled ramps, and pistachio crumble. It only gets wilder from there - both in terms of titles and ingredients - with items like the ham wallet, lollipopped chicken, and the My F*cking Burger all displaying the same kind of subtle trippiness (and deliciousness)."},{"name":"Forget Me Not","cost":2,"address":"\n227 Clayton St.\nDenver, CO 80206\n+17202595369\n","cuisine":"Bar","review":"The front patio of Forget Me Not can often be found lined with massive crystal vats of large-format cocktails, glasses of organic wine, the occasional plate of caviar, and plenty of people looking very content with their current reality. Rumors of a lobster crunch wrap that occasionally joins the menu add to the allure here, with each day seeing slight adjustments to a menu that favors cheese and salumi boards, Spanish razor clams, and a colorful crudite laid out on ice-filled oyster platters. Despite being a little chic (did we mention the caviar?), this place never feels exclusive and is one of our favorites for spending a long night out in Denver."},{"name":"Brut\u00f8","cost":4,"address":"\n1801 Blake St\nDenver, CO 80202\n720.325.2195\n","cuisine":"Fusion","review":"After spending the better part of a year serving wood-fired pizzas and oysters, Bruto changed directions, opting to become a chef\u2019s counter with two services per evening. The food itself also changed dramatically, as the chef transformed the place into a celebration of the food of Mexico, Texas, Colorado, Japan, and Korea. This is a special place built for special occasions, with dishes changing seasonally and really whenever else they feel like it. They also grow lots of things onsite, with hydroponic systems, pickling jars. and drying racks making great use of each piece of the carefully sourced ingredients. And the dishes do a great job of highlighting all of those details with things like rotating augachiles, hearth bread with mole blanco and miso butter, and wagyu with wild mushroom and mole negro."},{"name":"Blackbelly","cost":3,"address":"\n1606 Conestoga St\nBoulder, CO 80301\n303-247-1000\n","cuisine":"American","review":"Whatever it is that\u2019s caused you to take the 45-minute drive up to Boulder, be it the hiking trails or promises of a place where the kombucha flows like wine, no trip is complete without a stop at Blackbelly. If you go early, stop by the deli counter for one of their great breakfast burritos. But head over in the evening for an experience that highlights produce and prime cuts from local farms, most of which aren\u2019t much further away from the restaurant than Denver. Crispy pig ears sit comfortably next to fresh-flown oysters and an endless array of never-to-be-repeated charcuterie items aged right next door. While your server may not always be able to go full Portlandia and tell you the name of the chicken you\u2019re eating, there\u2019s also a good chance that if you catch them on the right night, they may be able to dig it up from somewhere."},{"name":"Temaki Den","cost":4,"address":"\n3350 Brighton Blvd Unit #100\nDenver, CO 80216\n(720) 465-9263\n","cuisine":"Sushi","review":"Temaki Den is the new hand roll spot from the team behind one of Denver\u2019s longest-held crown jewels, Sushi Den. Located in the center of The Source in RiNo - a food hall composed of several of the city\u2019s other heavy hitters - this largely counter-service operation is slightly more casual than its predecessor. Sashimi, appetizers, a few rolls, and several sweets provide the bulk of the menu - with the beautifully arranged hand rolls being filled generously with ingredients like salmon skin, fatty tuna, wagyu, and daikon radish sprouts. This is a place where you can see and be seen, although most people will probably be too busy looking at their food to notice you."},{"name":"Yuan Wonton","cost":1,"address":"\n\n,  \n720-961-3406\n","cuisine":"Chinese","review":"Wherever and whenever Yuan Wonton pulls up, there is guaranteed to be a crowd. When the truck first opened, block-long lines would form as hungry dumpling-lovers waited patiently for the famous chili wontons and whatever else happened to be on the menu that day. Over the last year, the team moved its system to online, with website crashes and two to three minute sellouts likening the ordering process more to coveted shoe releases or acquiring impossible to get concert tickets. Recently, lines began forming again, a sure sign that nature is healing. The thumb-sized wontons, drenched in a particularly zesty house-made chili crisp, tend to disappear so quickly after they\u2019re opened, it would come as no surprise to find a to-go box of them on StockX or any other website where rarities get scalped at a massive premium."},{"name":"El Taco De Mexico","cost":1,"address":"\n714 Santa Fe Drive\nDenver, CO 80204\n(303) 623-3926\n","cuisine":"Mexican","review":"El Taco de Mexico is an institution. You can tell by the cauldrons of green chili - so big that some of the ladies working the stoves have to use a step-ladder to stir it - that this is hallowed ground. This is the place to go for tacos stacked high with lengua, tripe, al pastor, and barbacoa. There are also tortas, tamales, soups, and hamburgers, and no matter what you order, the service is always super quick. The only real rule here is that everything should be paired with a massive glass of house-made horchata. Trust us."},{"name":"Onefold","cost":2,"address":"\n1429 E 18th Ave\nDenver, CO 80218\n303-954-0877\n","cuisine":"Brunch","review":"If your group tends to argue about the superior merits of breakfast burritos vs. scrambles, frittatas, or croissant sandwiches, Onefold in Uptown is a place to find all the best bits of a morning meal all on one table. You can opt for a congee - with chicken and duck broth, duck confit, poached eggs, scallions, and salted ginger - or grab a breakfast quesadilla or chilaquiles. Of course, there are mimosas, but for anyone who wants to veer away from the pre-noon classic, there\u2019s bourbon-laced Vietnamese coffee, a Bloody Maria, and a selection of Dry Dock hard seltzers. And in what may be Denver\u2019s most decadent treat, no visit here is complete without an order of the bacon fried rice, with plenty of chili oil and duck fat fried eggs."},{"name":"Twansburger","cost":1,"address":"\n\n,  \n","cuisine":"Burgers","review":"In the spring of 2021, Twansburger began showing up in various lots around town, generally as part of some established pop-up featuring a selection of other up-and-comers. And even from the get-go, this place has attracted a loyal following while opting to keep things super simple. Here you have two options: a single or a double. It\u2019s best to go double, especially if you were lured from blocks away by the smell of perfectly-spiced patties wafting indiscriminately in all directions. Outside of that, your options are limited - burgers come with homemade pickles, diced white onion, shredded lettuce, American cheese, and house sauce. But that\u2019s part of what makes the place so comforting, second only to all the smiling faces of those who surely finished their burger just a few steps from the register."},{"name":"Seoul Korean BBQ And Hot Pot","cost":3,"address":"\n2080 S. Havana St.\nAurora, CO 80014\n303-632-7576\n","cuisine":"Korean","review":"While Aurora has its fair share of bustling Korean barbecue restaurants, none of them are quite as festive as Seoul Korean BBQ and Hot Pot. The plates here always seem to be just a little fuller than what we\u2019re used to and each one always arrives just a little faster than anywhere else on the block. The servers seem to anticipate your desires a good five minutes before you yourself have thought of them, with an endless array of banchan always being swapped out before anyone at the table has taken the last bite. A little excess is expected here - especially in the form of endless stacks of thick-cut pork belly, jowl, and collar - but it\u2019s also encouraged, and it\u2019s only as you find yourself waddling to the car that you realize how full and happy you\u2019ve become."},{"name":"Super Mega Bien","cost":3,"address":"\n1260 25th St\nDenver, CO 80205\n7202694695\n","cuisine":"Latin","review":"When a dim sum cart rolls by the tables of Super Mega Bien, you can expect small plates of lamb barbacoa, Brazilian shrimp sopa, fried plantains, and steamed buns with sweetened condensed milk to hit the table just as quickly as you can order them. Here you can eat spring rolls with sun-dried tomatoes and cheese between sips from a tall glass of cachaca, or opt for ceviche and Spanish croquettes alongside a hop-infused gin and tonic. There are also family-style dishes, like full racks of ribs coated in green chili, and steaming lamb barbacoa that comes wrapped in banana leaf. Just make sure you order enough to share (or not)."},{"name":"Pho 95","cost":1,"address":"\n1401 S Federal Blvd\nDenver, CO 80219\n(303) 936-3322\n","cuisine":"Vietnamese","review":"Pho 95 is the kind of place that always seems to have a small wait, be it the depths of winter or a scorching mid-August day. And even though there are easily 15 other pho restaurants within jogging distance, this is the place to go in Little Saigon. The pho, especially the bowls overflowing with the spot\u2019s real claim to fame - a fried-garlic heavy veggie broth - always arrive with heaping plates of basil, dandelion, limes, and beansprouts. Though for anyone not quite so soup-inclined, the menu also has beef short rib plates, noodle bowls, and crispy noodle options."},{"name":"Open","cost":2,"address":"\n2706 Larimer St\nDenver, CO 80205\n","cuisine":"Sandwiches","review":"Googling \u201cOpen Sandwich Denver\u201d will inevitably take you to a list of every available sandwich place that is not currently closed. And even offline, Open can also be hard to find in real life. It serves its sandwiches from the back of American Bonded, a dimly-lit cocktail bar known for its great and affordable drinks. The only real indication that Open is there is a small podium bearing its name. But find it you should, as the spot came up with the rather novel concept of reaching out to some of the city\u2019s best chefs and having each one contribute a different sandwich to the menu. Everything is good, but The Lee - a Sichuan French Dip with a ruby-red, tongue-numbing dipping sauce from Hop Alley\u2019s own Tommy Lee - is the one you should make a priority."},{"name":"Restaurant Olivia","cost":3,"address":"\n260 Downing\nDenver, CO 80209\n303-999-0395\n","cuisine":"Pasta","review":"If you\u2019ve been planning on finally confessing some deep feelings to someone and need a white tablecloth to do it over, Restaurant Olivia is probably a good room for it. Especially if that certain someone likes quiet, candle-lit dining rooms complete with the kind of service that is usually reserved for visiting dignitaries. You can expect the homemade pasta to feature ingredients like black truffle, bay scallops, and Maine lobster. But even if you\u2019re someone who enjoys eating their body weight in noodles alone, no visit here is complete without a plate of seared foie gras, which comes spread atop some pillowy banana bread and is served with a bacon and Madeira jus, and a legitimately transformative foie gras gelato. And as with everything else, the cocktails here (and even non-alcoholic drinks) are approachable, despite being made with teas, house infusions, and even foraged ingredients. There\u2019s a Nutella Boulevardier and a Carrot Negroni,  each of which works even better than it looks on paper."},{"name":"Finn\u2019s Manor","cost":2,"address":"\n2927 Larimer St\nDenver, CO 80205\n","cuisine":"Five Points","review":"If you have a large group, round them up at Finn\u2019s. It\u2019s basically one big covered patio filled with food trucks (you\u2019ll find BBQ, Filipino, Jamaican, steamed buns, and ice cream). And just off the main patio, there\u2019s a cajun-themed cocktail bar where the group can kill time playing card games with a ridiculous amount of whiskey."},{"name":"Ale House at Amato\u2019s","cost":2,"address":"\n2501 16th St\nDenver, CO 80211\n(303) 433-9734\n","cuisine":"Bar Food","review":"The Ale House has been the unofficial drinking hub in LoHi for quite some time, and for good reason.The patio up top also provides a nice view of the Denver cityscape, while the patio downstairs provides nice people watching. There\u2019s also a full menu of typical but solid bar food that we endorse."},{"name":"Historians Ale House","cost":2,"address":"\n24 Broadway\nDenver, CO 80203\n(720) 479-8505\n","cuisine":"Bar Food","review":"According to the website, Historians is all about giving you \u201ca unique Colorado experience,\u201d which apparently means they have a ton of locally-brewed beers and a menu with a lot of locally-sourced ingredients. The patio up top has great mountain views and big tables for larger groups, and the happy hour includes half-off bottles of wine on Wednesdays. If you can\u2019t make it after work, late-night drinks or big group brunches are also a good move here."},{"name":"Highland Tap and Burger","cost":2,"address":"\n2219 W 32nd Ave\nDenver, CO 80211\n(720) 287-4493\n","cuisine":"Bar Food","review":"Highland Tap is one of the best spots in town no matter the time of day (or night) for drinks and some food. The burger is great, the waits are never too long, and the front patio makes for great people watching. Get a side of the kids mac and cheese (trust us when we tell you it\u2019s way better than the regular version), and watch the K-State folks in the bar area get rowdy when the Wildcats play."},{"name":"Highland Tavern","cost":1,"address":"\n3400 Navajo St\nDenver, CO 80211\n(303) 433-1990\n","cuisine":"Bar Food","review":"The Tavern has a weird 80\u2019s hair band nostalgia-meets-Vegas sports bar vibe, and it turns out that Poison and baseball blend together really well. It also doesn\u2019t hurt that the Tavern has some of the best bar food in town. Get some tater tots, head to the large covered patio upstairs, and plan to stay a while. If you can\u2019t be at Coors Field for a Rockies game, watching it here is your next best option."},{"name":"Whiskey Tango Foxtrot","cost":2,"address":"\n2907 Huron St #106\nDenver, CO 80202\n(303) 226-1540\n","cuisine":"American","review":"WTF is the perfect example of why you shouldn\u2019t judge a book by its cover. It\u2019s true that it\u2019s mainly a spot for the bottomless brunch crowd, but the Southern food is worth putting up with having to hear about how the people around you \u201ccrushed it last night, bro.\u201d Also, the best time to be here isn\u2019t on the weekends - it\u2019s after work on a weekday. The covered rooftop patio also has a good amount of space, and a great view of the downtown skyline."},{"name":"Local 46","cost":2,"address":"\n4586 Tennyson St\nDenver, CO 80212\n(720) 524-3792\n","cuisine":"Bar Food","review":"Local 46 is a few minutes from the more popular part of Tennyson St., but it\u2019s worth the trip, and a great way to avoid the crowds in that area. It\u2019s a laid-back beer drinking type of place, so bring your low-key friends for a big group hang. The wide-open patio out back has a ton of seating, ping pong, and an outdoor food hut that occasionally serves burgers and excellent sausage plates (usually weekends and evenings). And if you\u2019re here in the summer, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll see some live music."},{"name":"Avanti","cost":2,"address":"\n3200 Pecos St\nDenver, CO 80211\n(720) 269-4778\n","cuisine":"LoHi","review":"This market-style food court sits just west of the city in the Lower Highlands, and it\u2019s best utilized as the rendezvous point for your crew in the afternoon or early evening, before heading out on the town for a big night. While the food is simply decent (the arepas are your best bet) and a bit overpriced, the rooftop bar is huge and has some of the best views in town, and the multiple bar areas mean you\u2019ll never have to wait too long for a drink."},{"name":"Postino","cost":2,"address":"\n2715 17th St\nDenver, CO 80211\n(303) 433-6363\n","cuisine":"Wine Bar","review":"Postino is a nice (but not stuffy) wine bar with a ton of affordable options (the daily happy hour is $5 glasses). The patio out back has a good amount of space, and as far as food goes, we like the bruschetta to snack on (and even out your wine consumption). This is a good spot for girls\u2019 night out."},{"name":"Briar Commons Brewery","cost":2,"address":"\n2298 N Clay St\nDenver, CO 80211\n","cuisine":"Bar Food","review":"Briar Commons is a brewery\/restaurant type of place, and it\u2019s a great spot for a guys night or day drinking outing. The food is decent, but you\u2019re really here for the brewed-on-site beer. And the roof deck that looks over Jefferson Park. If you do get hungry while taking in the views, go for the burger."},{"name":"El Five","cost":3,"address":"\n 2930 Umatilla, Fifth Floor\nDenver, CO 80218\n303.524.9193\n","cuisine":"Spanish","review":"Five floors up in the Lower Highlands, El Five\u2019s patio has a beautiful panorama view of the downtown skyline and a tapas and cocktail menu that\u2019s just as good as the sights. The Mediterranean food is a bit pricey, but it\u2019s definitely worth the splurge for a nice night out. Make sure to get the shawarma spiced lamb ribs, and if the patio tables are full, a seat at the bar has the same views and faster drinks service."},{"name":"The Monkey Barrel","cost":1,"address":"\n4401 Tejon St\nDenver, Colorado 80211\n720-638-3655\n","cuisine":"Sandwiches","review":"One of Denver\u2019s favorite Italian delis is back and running the shop out of the Monkey Barrel bar in Sunnyside. The old school bodega vibe has been switched out for old school band posters, but the menu is the same. We like it best for lunch, but it\u2019s open until 2am to satisfy your late night needs too. The meatball and the italian sausage subs are our favorites, and you can play mario kart in the back booths while you wait for them to come out."},{"name":"Brider","cost":1,"address":"\n1644 Platte St\nDenver, CO 80202\n","cuisine":"American","review":"Brider is our favorite upscale fast-casual spot for lunch in the city- fast-casual because you order at the counter, upscale because the food is restaurant-quality. There\u2019s a fresh rotisserie chicken right behind the checkout counter, sweet potato and avocado salads, porchetta and kimchi sandwiches, rotating pizza options daily, and freshly baked pastries to finish off the meal. If you want to stay awhile, there\u2019s also a full bar with a good happy hour deal. The only downside is that the parking situation isn\u2019t great, so plan accordingly."},{"name":"Masterpiece Delicatessen","cost":1,"address":"\n1575 Central St\nDenver, CO 80211\n(303) 561-3354\n","cuisine":"Sandwiches","review":"Every city needs a go-to sandwich shop, and Masterpiece is Denver\u2019s best. There are a few around town, but we usually find ourselves at the LoHi location. The menu doesn\u2019t have a lot of items you haven\u2019t seen before, but they do a good job of making the classics a little more interesting - the ham and cheese comes on a thyme baguette with some crunch to it. The veggie is also the best in town. Get it and head over the pedestrian bridge for a picnic in Confluence Park."},{"name":"Salt & Grinder","cost":1,"address":"\n3609 W 32nd Ave\nDenver, CO 80211\n","cuisine":"Sandwiches","review":"Salt & Grinder is our favorite sandwich shop to hit when you have some time to kill (because finishing an entire meal here will take some dedication). The menu has Italian classics like meatball and chicken parm, but also salads, soup, and breakfast options. Post up on the patio with The Frankie and a beer and do some people watching."},{"name":"Pizzeria Locale","cost":1,"address":"\n3484 W 32nd Ave\nDenver, CO 80211\n","cuisine":"Pizza","review":"This is a fast-casual pizzeria from the people at Frasca, which alone is enough to get people in the door. But the pizza here is what keeps everyone coming back. They\u2019re Neapolitan style, and the fresh, chewy dough and excellent toppings make them a serious contender for best thin crust in town. They also come out in under 5 minutes, so they\u2019re a great move for a quick lunch or dinner."},{"name":"Bones","cost":2,"address":"\n701 Grant St\nDenver, CO 80203\n(303) 860-2929\n","cuisine":"Japanese","review":"Bones has a small but reliable Asian fusion menu, with things like duck confit steamed buns and braised pork udon. The patio and the open kitchen make it a surprisingly great place for a date - if your date doesn\u2019t mind watching you stuff your face with escargot pot stickers and bone marrow. (If your date does mind, you maybe should not be dating.) We also like it as a mid-week lunch spot if you work around Governors Park."},{"name":"Denver Central Market","cost":2,"address":"\n2669 Larimer St.\nDenver, Colorado 80205\n","cuisine":"River North","review":"This food hall sits right in the middle of the Rino neighborhood, and has a nice variety of stuff to choose from (pizza, sandwiches, seafood, sandwiches, and ice cream, to name a few), as well a full bar with plenty of seating. It\u2019s a nice spot to grab a drink and snack and hang around for a bit during the day. The price points are a little higher than similar markets around town (Avanti, Stanley Market), but it\u2019s a great option if you\u2019re around the arts district."},{"name":"Royal Rooster","cost":2,"address":"\n3316 Tejon St\nDenver, CO 80211\n720.420.0622\n","cuisine":"Burgers","review":"Old Major is no secret, but we like it best on weekdays during lunch when the patio and bar areas transform into Royal Rooster. From 11am-3pm, Rooster sets up shop with a limited but excellent menu of sandwiches (seven options total). The semi-hidden Lower Highlands spot is one of Denver\u2019s best under the radar options, and while the chicken sandwiches are excellent, the burger is our favorite in the city."},{"name":"Woodgrain Bagels","cost":1,"address":"\n2525 Arapahoe Avenue\nBoulder, Colorado 80302\n","cuisine":"Bagels","review":"If you don\u2019t know about Montreal-style bagels (we didn\u2019t either), let Woodgrain be your introduction. Compared to ones you\u2019d find in New York, these are sweeter and more dense. We think it has something to do with being boiled and then wood-fired, but we\u2019re more concerned with how excellent of a sandwich they make. Go for the breakfast bacon, egg, and cheese on a poppyseed or everything."},{"name":"The Pig & The Sprout","cost":2,"address":"\n1900 Chestnut Pl\nDenver, CO 80202\n(720) 535-9719\n","cuisine":"American","review":"A casual new spot near Coors Field downtown, The Pig & Sprout has a wide open bar space and solid American food. It\u2019s mostly what you\u2019d expect from an upscale sports bar, except there are some twists - namely, half the menu\u2019s focus on vegetarian plates. We\u2019ve been impressed with most things on the menu, but the pork tacos are our go-to."},{"name":"Sloan\u2019s Lake Tap & Burger","cost":2,"address":"\n1565 Raleigh St\nDenver, CO 80204\n","cuisine":"Bar Food","review":"Sister to the popular Lower Highlands Tap & Burger, Sloan\u2019s has a more refined vibe, but still serves the same pub-style menu you\u2019ve come to love from the original. If the Tap & Burger locations were a mullet, this one would be the business in front - use it for lunch meetings and other situations requiring a little more polish. This is an excellent, kind of upscale brewpub that also serves as a great late-afternoon spot to catch a game on TV (after the business crowd has moved on)."},{"name":"The Post Chicken And Beer","cost":2,"address":"\n2200 S Broadway\nDenver, CO 80210\n","cuisine":"Southern","review":"The Post is everything Cracker Barrel wants to be - homey country feels, southern charm, and delicious, gravy-soaked comfort food. Only instead of a kitschy gift shop, golf tee triangle games, and terrible food, The Post is actually a place you want to hang out - especially because they also have a brewery on the premises. Best for large groups and lazy afternoons, and home of some of the best family-style fried chicken in Denver."},{"name":"Quality Italian","cost":4,"address":"\n241 Columbine St.\nDenver, CO 80206\n","cuisine":"Italian","review":"A recent transplant from NYC, this is Denver\u2019s newest steakhouse and one of the more hyped special occasion restaurants in town. The upscale setup involves some gimmicks (black-tie-wearing staff, tableside steak preparation), and a high-priced menu. All of which might give you pause, but once the meats and pastas start to roll out, all concerns will fade away. Everything here is top notch, and very much worth your time and money. They serve lunch, but big group throw-down dinners are what you want to use this place for."},{"name":"Fish N Beer","cost":3,"address":"\n3510 Larimer St\nDenver, CO 80205\n303.248.3497\n","cuisine":"Seafood","review":"A newer RiNo spot serving a small but solid menu of fresh seafood and (you guessed it) beer. All the food here is worth your time - especially the grilled oyster plates and the blowfish basket. The main entree options are good but pricey, and make for a nice solo dinner or date night. However, we like this place best for the smaller plates and early afternoon happy hours. Especially on weekdays when tables are easy to come by without need for reservations."},{"name":"Saigon Bowl","cost":1,"address":"\n333 S Federal Blvd Unit 134\nDenver, CO 80219\n(303) 935-2427\n","cuisine":"Vietnamese","review":"Saigon has been a South Federal staple forever, and the food here never misses a beat. We especially like the vegetarian options when we\u2019re looking to act a little healthier during the winter months. The vegetarian pho here is the best in Denver."},{"name":"Avelina","cost":3,"address":"\n1550 17th St\nDenver, CO 80202\n720.904.6711\n","cuisine":"American","review":"Conveniently located in one of the busier downtown areas, Avelina is a new fine dining dinner spot, but we like it best for classier work lunches, or post-work cocktails. Stick with the salad menu if you\u2019re doing lunch (warm artichoke and baby kale are the best), and definitely look to grab seats at the bar."},{"name":"Dio Mio","cost":2,"address":"\n3264 Larimer St\nDenver, CO 80205\n(303) 562-1965\n","cuisine":"Italian","review":"Dio Mio is pairing a fast-casual atmosphere with fresh, homemade pastas. Seems like a fun idea, and we like the relaxed order-at-the-counter setup. But the food just isn\u2019t quite up to par with other fresh pasta shops around town. We\u2019re hoping that has more to do with the newness of this place, but as it is right now, Dio Mio is best for quick apps (especially the fried mozzarella) and a glass of wine after work - not the full dinner play."},{"name":"Rush Bowls","cost":2,"address":"\n1665 Central St.\nDenver, CO 80211\n(720) 287-2844\n","cuisine":"American","review":"A quick acai bowl to-go on your way to work in the morning is never a bad idea, and Rush Bowls is best place to grab said bowls in Denver.

But in the case of The Plimoth, we're going to go ahead and throw caution to the wind - it's the absolute best date night spot in Denver. Hype around this place may have died down since opening a few years ago, but if you're in need of a special place to take someone special (even if that someone is you), set your course here. \nThe Plimoth is a quaint neighborhood spot with an intimate setting, both in actual size and vibes. The cracker jack box dining room keeps the tables close, enough so you might become friends with your neighbors, but you won't be bothered by it. Especially after the food and wine starts to roll out. \nThe menu leans toward the heavier side of things, so be ready to eat stuff like sweet potato pierogies, pork rillette, and cracklin' chicken - which might all sound simple, but the flavors are nuts. If at this point you're thinking that this kind of rich food isn't ideal for a first date, you're probably right. Which is why you should consider coming here with someone who's seen you take down a plate of food before. And still likes you.\nThere's an elegance to The Plimoth, but zero pretension. And regardless of the occasion, dinner here always feels special. Just remember that we're only responsible for making the perfect date night restaurant recommendation.

Never was a phrase more relevant to a restaurant as that one is to Spuntino. We've gotten very familiar with this place, and have come to rely on two things about it: we always know we're going to be surprised with something new, and not surprised when we love it. Does that mean Spuntino is predictable? Absolutely. But in the best way possible. The restaurant is so consistently good, we always walk in expecting great things. And so far, those expectations have been met every single time.\nTheir menu changes with the season, but it's generally full of handmade, simple noodle dishes - we've had meaty bolognese plates that fill us up after three bites, and we've also had light, broth-based specials that taste so good we order two. Add in their small but strong wine list, and Spuntino is the perfect choice for special occasions. Especially date night, or if you\u2019re looking to celebrate something with a small group.\nThe corner space located in the Lower Highlands is exactly the kind of quaint spot everyone wants in their neighborhood. It's an especially great early-evening move, as after dinner you can head down the street a few blocks to the more happening section of LoHi to grab some drinks or just walk off all the carbs you just stuffed down your gullet.\nOne other unexpected thing we've come to expect: Spuntino is somehow usually pretty easy to get into. We're always baffled by this, as you'd assume a place this good would be consistently packed. But we're selfishly happy it's remained largely a secret. Here's hoping that's just one more part of Spuntino that stays the same."},{"name":"Coperta","cost":3,"address":"\nCoperta, 400 E 20th Ave.\nDenver, CO 80203\n3037368400\n","cuisine":"Italian","review":"Coperta is one of Denver\u2019s best new pasta spots, with a menu full of plates designed to share.

A weird backstory, off-the-wall design scheme, or cryptic name having nothing to do with the food is fun. We get it. For example, who doesn\u2019t want to eat farm-to-table fusion fare in a converted turn of the century mortuary? But even when checking out a relatively mysterious place for the first time, we still usually know what we\u2019re getting into - except in the case of Mister Tuna.\nWe had heard no real details, and only a few facts:\n\nThe menu and space pays homage to Hawaiian food culture\nThere\u2019s a pickle bar\nThere\u2019s a giant mural depicting the Chef\u2019s mom\nThere are pictures of a pet parrot named Mister Tuna\n\nTurns out not knowing what to expect was a really good thing. Regardless of what they\u2019re trying to do at Mister Tuna (we still aren\u2019t completely sure), we love it. \nThe menu is a nice hodgepodge of pretty much everything: shellfish, pasta, pizza, tacos, sashimi...lamb. All of which are priced high, but done really well. The King Crab is one of the best bites in the city right now. The pastas are fresh and rich, and perfect for the colder fall weather. And the sashimi, one of the only things that has any real relevance to the restaurant name,  is excellent. \nThe space is trendy, has plenty of flash, and is nothing even remotely close to being reminiscent of Hawaii. But don\u2019t sweat the inconsistencies. All you need to know is that the food and atmosphere at Tuna are well worth the trip, especially for upcoming date nights. Nothing really makes sense, but it doesn\u2019t matter, because it\u2019s all good."},{"name":"Wooden Spoon","cost":2,"address":"\n2418 W 32nd Ave\nDenver, CO 80211\n(303) 999-0327\n","cuisine":"Dessert","review":"Denver\u2019s known for many things - craft beer, farm-to-table food sourcing, beautiful people, legal weed. But one important category you don\u2019t hear much about: bakeries. We\u2019re talking full-scale operations with hard-to-pronounce pastries, gooey egg sandwiches, and quaint neighborhood charm. But Wooden Spoon is here to make some noise in that category, from its small, under-the-radar corner shop. \nYou might miss it if you aren\u2019t paying attention, as it\u2019s the size of a broom closet compared to the rest of the block\u2019s storefronts. Actually \u2013 you might miss it if it\u2019s a weekday past noon. Because on a Saturday or Sunday morning, you\u2019ll definitely spot it based on the dogs and strollers parked outside alone. What it lacks in comfortable seating and Wi-Fi (your computer won\u2019t fit on their tiny tables anyway), Wooden Spoon easily makes up for with its friendly service, and more importantly, impressive spread of baked goods. Even your gluten free, dairy free, vegetarian friend will find something to love here. That being said, our favorite items aren\u2019t adhering to any of those requirements.\nWooden Spoon serves lunch, but the breakfast situation here is what keeps us coming back. More specifically, the breakfast sandwich keeps us (and everyone else posted up here every weekend) coming back. There aren\u2019t many places in Denver to get a great egg sandwich, but Wooden Spoon has perfected it: steaming hot eggs topped with melty cheddar cheese, bacon, and just enough toasty brioche to hold it all together. It\u2019s rich enough to cure a hangover, but still leaves you feeling okay about your arteries. Maybe it\u2019s just our overactive imagination, but the servers give you this ridiculously big smile when handing off your to-go bag - it makes you feel like you\u2019re in on the neighborhood\u2019s best kept secret.\nWhether you\u2019re here for the first or tenth time, you\u2019ll want to bring some friends so you can try as many things as possible (not too many friends - remember, this place is small). But if you aren\u2019t rolling deep, don\u2019t worry, the only way you can go wrong is if you get here after they sell out (which does happen). \nEven if you\u2019ve never thought about the fact that you needed more bakeries in your life, Wooden Spoon\u2019s breakfast food is good enough that you\u2019ll wonder how you ever got through your Saturdays without it."},{"name":"Ohana Island Kitchen","cost":2,"address":"\n2563 15th St #105\nDenver, CO 80211\n(303) 718-6580\n","cuisine":"Hawaiian","review":"Everybody has their favorite hole-in-the-wall spot: a quaint dive bar, a hamburger stand with questionable health inspector records, an old Mason hall serving strong coffee. We came to love Ohana Island Kitchen when it was a literal hole in the wall: a window-font station in a shared space on a quiet corner just west of The Platte River. Thanks to much-deserved success, it has since evolved into a full-scale operation serving excellent Hawaiian lunch favorites from its own shop (across the street from the hole in the wall). Say aloha to Denver\u2019s best poke stop: Ohana Island Kitchen.The small, cafe-style operation is all about fresh, big flavors - think teriyaki-esque pulled pork, high-quality tuna, sweet rice, and a good amount of spam (don\u2019t be afraid). The food alone sells the place, but the picnic-style seating situation and very friendly staff really ups Ohana\u2019s game, and works well for both hurried and leisurely lunches. \nThe higher prices might give you pause considering it\u2019s lunch, but rest assured, you get what you pay for. Plus, we guarantee eating food this good while relaxing for a few minutes at a picnic table will cure your mid-day work stress. Grab a buddy or two and order the entire menu to share.

But lately in our experience with new places around town, said focus has signalled sluggish service and sub-par food. Thankfully, that\u2019s not the case here. The Preservery is firing on all cylinders.The menu is designed to rotate with the season, and as far as the summer goes, we\u2019re fat and happy. From small plates, to sandwiches, to full-scale sophisticated dinners, everything we\u2019ve tried is excellent. The service too, is great - they have, without a doubt, one of the friendliest staffs around. And they aren\u2019t doing it for the gratuity - taking after the recently trendy NYC model, tip is already included in all the prices.\nThe patio is another big highlight. Positioned just off the bar with enough shade to avoid melting your face off, it\u2019s the kind of porch that\u2019s somehow perfect for dates and bigger group hangs alike. \nAt the southern end of RiNo, The Preservery\u2019s location makes for a nice walk if you\u2019re coming from anywhere around North LoDo - especially before or after a Rockies game. It\u2019s close to Coors Field, yes, but far enough away to avoid drunken stragglers looking to get rowdy. Skip the ballgame traffic here sipping drinks on the patio.\nAll in, The Preservery looks good, it feels good, it tastes good - a nice little trifecta that combines to form what we believe is one of Denver\u2019s best new restaurants, and one you should definitely take advantage of this summer.

Dingy walls, barred windows, torn-up barstools, wobbly tables, bad taxidermy... it\u2019s pretty clear there isn\u2019t much effort going into room staging here. We respect that. It\u2019s honestly what you want from a good BBQ place, because it lets you know all the focus is on the right thing - the food. At GH, that\u2019s absolutely the case. They have all the makings of a real Texas smokehouse, including a small-cabin-sized smoker (named Betty) on the patio out back, currently pushing out the best BBQ we\u2019ve ever had in Denver. And the space is actually a 100-year-old Croatian dance hall, which is at least a cool historical fact.\nBrisket, pork, ribs, turkey, sausage, a few sides, and some pie make up the menu, and you can\u2019t go wrong with any of the above - especially the ribs. These are honestly the best ribs in town. Tender, juicy meat that sticks to bone just enough to make the small amount of work you have to put in for each bite totally worth it. Add in the dance hall and live music they offer on the regular and we\u2019re probably going to make GH our official summer headquarters. \nThe only complaint we have is that they occasionally offer weekend yoga classes. We\u2019re willing to give that a pass... as long as they let us grab some of those ribs during our warrior pose."},{"name":"Blue Pan","cost":2,"address":"\n3930 W 32nd Ave\nDenver, CO 80212\n(720) 456-7666\n","cuisine":"Pizza","review":"Detroit.

Detroit-style pizza is highly delicious, and Blue Pan has brought some hip-to-be-square magic-ness to Denver. This tiny, Michigan-proud pizzeria has quickly become part of our regular rotation for quality LoHi eats.Twist our arm for a gripe about the place, and we might (strong might) mention the seating situation inside - \u201ctiny\u201d puts it pretty lightly (seats 10-15 tops) - but that gripe has more to do with us not wanting to wait for a table than the experience BP\u2019s small interior size brings. Despite the elbow rubbing, we like the down home vibe this place gives off. It feels like a small mom & pop stop where neighborhood kids congregate after school for a slice, some soda and a game of jacks out front.\nIf you can swing a table and dine-in, do it. Especially if you\u2019re eating alone. A seat at the bar is one of the best spots in town to catch a game on TV solo. Plus the staff is great at keeping you company. But don\u2019t sleep on the take-out operation - the food doesn\u2019t miss a beat if you\u2019d rather get down at home. The Parma Italia and Brooklyn Bridge options are our favorites, but you won\u2019t be mad at much on the menu. Just know that while they do offer a few thin(er) crust options, we don\u2019t recommend veering away from the Detroit-style mains. Embrace the Motor City stuff and you\u2019ll be happy.

Not only will an unaccompanied breakfast help you avoid the wait on weekends (and you will have to wait), it'll also give you a chance to get serious with an order of corn bread rancheros and custard toast without judgement from those friends who always give you crap for ordering \"more than you can eat.\" As if that's ever possible. Go big here and be proud. The cool waitstaff will likely cheer you on by bringing several rounds of their favorite cocktail to help incentivize your resolve to keep eating.\nIt's always easy to say a place like this has something for everyone, but in this case, it\u2019s actually true. Our only worry is that more people will find out about the U and make the wait longer for us when we head over.

However, we quite honestly needed a goddamn break from it. How many times do we have to hear about your farm 15 miles away and how happy Milli the chicken is before slaughter?\nThankfully, there\u2019s a beer garden that gives us that break both in name and experience - we\u2019re talking about Recess - a place that doesn\u2019t look to be defined by outward, explicit environmental involvement. Look, we\u2019re sure they have the same concerns we all do, but we\u2019re grateful to see they're more concerned with giving you a relaxing afternoon or evening of fun and great food.\nThink open air bar facing a huge, multi-level patio with picnic seating, lawn games and good scenery.

To us, it\u2019s too subjective a title - being a \"best restaurant\" anywhere means you\u2019re good at literally everything; not just food, just wine, or just service and courtesy. So while we\u2019re hesitant to hand out a \"best restaurant in Colorado\" nod (partly because we haven\u2019t eaten everywhere in Colorado) we will admit that it only took a few trips to secure our very first Infatuation Denver 9.1 rating.\nFrasca\u2019s focus is as much about wine as it is about food, but not in an mutually exclusive way. It\u2019s based on an idea that balancing the two makes what\u2019s best about both, better. They do this really well. Add in their amazing service and ambiance, and you've got something special. From start to finish on each visit, Frasca makes us feel at home. Members of both the front and back of house staff have always seemed almost humbled to host us and every single other guest in the dining room. No pretension or overdone coddling - just a sort of inviting warmth...only not in a freaky Hansel & Gretel kind of way.

An unwavering devotion to John Elway, a constant fear of running into their grandma at their favorite weed shop, a continued and unjustified fear of Five Points, and a love for Edgewater Inn pizza. If any of the above don't ring true to you, go back to Iowa, you f*cking tourist.\nFor the newbies and uninitiated, Edgewater Inn serves the best pizza in Denver. I know, I know, throwing around lofty superlatives about pizza might get you shanked in Chicago or forced to watch a Knicks game in New York, but here this is a safe statement. Safe because Denver isn\u2019t really known for pizza. Safe despite the awesome stuff Cart Driver and Hops & Pie are cranking out. And safe because longtime classics are almost always the best.\nDon\u2019t believe us? Go find someone who didn\u2019t move here from California yesterday and ask.\nCouldn\u2019t find anyone? OK, keep reading.\nEdgewater Inn is basically a really clean dive bar that focuses on schooners of Coors and unbelievably good sausage pizza. The service is almost always great, but don\u2019t arrive hangry. Due to a serious take-out operation competing with the in-restaurant dining operation, your order will take 30 minutes or so.\nThat said, it\u2019s worth the wait and will give you time to talk about how crazy the weather is here or how awesome String Cheese was at Red Rocks."},{"name":"Guard and Grace","cost":4,"address":"\n1801 California St.\nDenver, CO 80202\n303-293-8500\n","cuisine":"Seafood","review":"It used to be that a power lunch anywhere outside of the tech center meant having a Kind bar mid-hike.

Enter Guard and Grace - a modern steakhouse currently standing court as lunch and dinner HQ for seemingly every business person traveling in and out of metro Denver.\nTurns out focusing that power lunch play around aloof usage of traveling corporate credit cards was genius. Monday through Friday, G&G; packs all 9,000+ square feet of its dining space with formal idea pitch-sters and boondogglers alike. It\u2019s huge, it\u2019s beautiful, and it\u2019s probably making more money than all of its patrons combined.\nLunch is king at G&G;, but the dinner features an expanded menu and the same suited up crowd\u2026 only more boozed up. This basically means the people watching gets really interesting at night. Dinner theatre at its best. If G&G; really wants to up its game, they might consider offering a dry cleaning service to help deal with all the grease and wine stained suits that tend to multiply post-sunset.\nLike any respectable steakhouse, both the lunch and dinner menus are huge. You can choose between a full raw bar, a wide variety of starter and sandwich options, a few heavy main courses, and of course, steak. Everything is expensive, but everything is good.

Sure, wine bars and bakeries pop up on certain blocks, but they\u2019re nothing you couldn\u2019t find in your own hood.\nWell, let\u2019s end all the Park Hill abstinence right now because Bistro Barbes is well worth your time and money.

With around three choices for each course, there is no risk of paralysis through analysis. The wine list is similarly pared down, but you won\u2019t lack good choices. Bistro Barbes touts itself as being grounded in French technique with flavors from North Africa, Spain, and the Mediterranean. The first claim is true, but the latter is questionable. Don\u2019t get us wrong, we\u2019re all in, but if the North African and Spanish flavors were turned up even 25 percent, we\u2019d be even higher on this place.

Kids are so stupid.  \nIt\u2019s easy to see why my younger-self loved this place \u2014 in many ways it\u2019s like a fast food joint. The burgers are a little greasy, served on sesame seed buns, and wrapped in paper. The fries and onion rings sit in plastic trays and all condiments come in a plastic caddy they bring to your table, complete with pickles, onions, etc.\nAs an adult man-boy, I find other reasons to appreciate this place. For one, it\u2019s got the character of a Wild West saloon mixed with the vibe of a cool urban hangout.\nProclaimed Denver\u2019s oldest bar, My Brother\u2019s Bar is a mix of old and new. Old: They crank Beethoven and Bach for plenty of hunched-over grandpas at the bar.

And while the accolades both locally and nationally have fizzled out a bit, it definitely continues to serve as a hotspot for food enthusiasts, Highlands aristocrats and hipsters alike. So, what can we tell you about this restaurant that you haven\u2019t heard? Probably not a lot, but we can offer some advice. If you\u2019re going to do Old Major, do it for an afternoon happy hour on the patio.\nHere are some tips if you decide to go this route: If they\u2019ll let you, try hard to order off the main menu, mainly to see if you can get your hands on some ham & biscuits from the dinner menu. If all else fails, eat a charcuterie plate. You'll also want to get there early and plan to stay for a long time. Sit on the patio, order a stiff drink, and watch the people go by. And whatever you do, don\u2019t come here on a first date. You need to be relaxed so you can enjoy quiet, comfortable people watching and uninhibited consumption of pork parts. Also keep in mind this isn\u2019t a more fiscally responsible way to experience Old Major. Cocktails alone will run close to $10 a pop, this will not be a cheap happy hour experience. But it will be worthwhile.\nWe should also clarify that recommending happy hour over the full-on dinner or brunch experience isn\u2019t our way of saying the headliners at Old Major are bad; you should definitely put it in rotation for both of those meals. But for our money, (and regardless, you\u2019re going to spend a lot of money) a nice long mid-week patio binge is where it\u2019s at."},{"name":"The Kitchen Denver","cost":3,"address":"\n1530 16th St.\nDenver, CO \n303-623-3127\n","cuisine":"American","review":"The Kitchen Denver is a beautiful space.

The views from the gigantic first floor windows make for great people watching, the staff is friendly, and the American bistro menu rotates with the seasons. Flavors are pretty standard, but they\u2019re also pretty darn good. Honestly there\u2019s really nothing to complain about... unless you\u2019ve been to the original Kitchen in Boulder. If that\u2019s the case, this new Kitchen just isn\u2019t going to match up.\nTo elaborate, let\u2019s take a step back. Close your eyes, and think about the first kitchen you had growing up - the family\u2019s main gathering spot, the nerve center for conversations about school, life, love...John Elway. All no doubt part of some pretty great early memories. Eventually though, through your parents upgrading to a nicer house or you moving out to your own place, that original kitchen went away. And with it, the nostalgia and brilliance of its predecessor. That\u2019s how we feel when we visit The Kitchen downtown Denver.\nTo be clear, you aren\u2019t going to have a bad experience at The Kitchen Denver. It\u2019s a safe bet, and there won\u2019t be any surprises. If you set your expectations right, you\u2019ll walk away satisfied. It just isn't going to be all that memorable.

Our advice, skip the explanations and learn through experience. In the modern Asian game, let ChoLon be your sensei.\nAdding twists to classic dim sum and larger course dishes, ChoLon is the ideal example of a good Asian \"fusion\" restaurant. Soup dumplings seem traditional on first inspection, and yet there is french onion soup inside of them. The bacon fried rice is a \"carbonara\" with runny egg on top. But ChoLon\u2019s ability to understand where twists & upgrades aren\u2019t needed might be even more impressive. The steamed buns are simple and delicious, with little bells and whistles - just an upgrade to meet the upscale, business-lunch-friendly environment.\nWe love pretty much everything we\u2019ve eaten here (and we\u2019ve eaten everything) and ChoLon is worth trying at least once.

The Latin-influenced menu is broken into three main sections: meat, sides, and breads, and is best designed for sharing and sampling among a group. Things like roasted goat and conchinita pibil come in quarter, half, or full pound servings, and will arrive at your table in a silver bowl. The idea is for you to get creative and customize your experience - order some tortillas, some Colorado lamb, maybe some fried sweet plantains (definitely some fried sweet plantains). But if that\u2019s too much responsibility, they'll happily suggest some meat\/side\/bread combinations. Just don't be afraid to let loose a little bit. Embrace the goat.\nWith a small space and no reservations, waits at Work & Class can quickly escalate, but we like to drop in at the end of happy hour and ride on into dinner.

Not sure that a rabbit and antelope sausage is something you can get down with? You can, and you will. All you have to do is let it into your life. And should you have some religious belief or policy about not eating cute things, don't you worry. Biker Jim's does a really good vegan dog as well.\nAside from a place to eat crazy\/delicious things, Biker Jim's near-LoDo location makes it a great spot to pre-game for a night out or hit up some late night eats.

Union Station is fortunate to have them as a tenant\nand if this is where Denver is going, we\u2019re fully on board."},{"name":"Black Eye Coffee","cost":2,"address":"\n3408 Navajo St.\nDenver, CO 80211\n","cuisine":"American","review":"It\u2019s hard to walk unassumingly into a place like Black Eye Coffee Shop. From an outsider\u2019s perspective, there\u2019s definitely an air of ostentation at play -nautical-ish interior design, \u20186\u20194\/160lb baristas, a deli refrigerator turned magazine rack.\nBut after you get past all that, you'll find that Black Eye has some of the best lattes and friendliest service in the city. There\u2019s a contagious caring and care-free attitude perpetuating the room, which is no doubt why both freelancers and corporate folks alike frequent the space to get stuff done. There\u2019s also a ton of neighborhood regulars, which helps prove its worth. Black Eye is like a hipster Cheers, only they don\u2019t serve beer, don\u2019t care about the Red Sox, and \u201cSam\u201d is only relevant because it\u2019s the name of all four dogs leashed up out front. They also have excellent food, which is why you see a full review of the place here on The Infatuation.\nPastries, quiches, and rolls originally occupied most of the menu at Black Eye to match the coffee brews, but lately they've expanded their offerings to include some good sweet and savory breakfast and lunch options. To be clear, their strong suit is still by far focused around beverages, but it\u2019s nice to have a place like this for a quick meal in the Highlands."},{"name":"Izakaya Den","cost":3,"address":"\n1487-A S.

This place has atmosphere in\nspades, something that's fairly unusual outside of downtown. It\u2019s straight up\nsexy - like silk sheets, candles, and Jodeci on shuffle sexy. If you\u2019ve been\nlooking for a new date spot, you can stop looking.\nAs you might have already heard, the food is top-notch too. There\u2019s something\nat Izakaya Den to please everyone, and dishes like the duck croquettes and\ntan-tan men noodles are particularly impressive. Also impressive is the fact\nthat Izakaya Den has carved out its own identity while living in the shadow of\nits beloved older brother Sushi Den. Luckily, the service matches the decor\nand the food. During our visits, two separate managers came by to check on us\nand make sure everything was good. That's the kind of attention to customer\nsatisfaction that's all too rare these days.\nRare like Jodeci."},{"name":"Federal Bar & Grill","cost":2,"address":"\n2544 Federal Blvd.\nDenver, CO 80211\n303-728-9479\n","cuisine":"American","review":"Walk into Federal Bar and Grill, and you might feel as though John\nTaffer and his band of Bar Rescue\njuggernauts were just there. There\u2019s a strategically placed popcorn machine\ndesigned to increase your thirst quotient by 33.4%. There is ping pong and\nTrivial Pursuit on hand to ensure the average customer buys 1.4 more rounds of\nbeers while in the heat of competition. Even the staff plays the blue-collar,\ndown-on-their-luck, but clearly possessing a heart-of-gold, role.\nThree straight weekends watching non-stop Spike TV neither confirmed nor\ndenied this origin story but we don\u2019t care - Federal Bar & Grill is damn good.\nTake a quick look at the menu and you will see this isn\u2019t a bunch of dumb-\ndowned munchies administrated by a hack cook (with a heart of gold) who can\u2019t\nwork the fryolater. Thought was put into the food, and the execution is\ncommendable. In fact, we\u2019re comfortable saying Federal Bar and Grill fits into\nthe \u201cbetter than most bar food but not quite as good as Fruition\u201d category we\njust created.\nIts location is also key. The Mile High\/Jefferson Park-area is starting to see\nHighlands-like rent, but places to walk to and have a good meal are still few\nand far between. That\u2019s changing with additions like Sarto\u2019s and Federal Bar &\nGrill. So you better buy in this area now, and by that I mean someone please\nmake me an offer on the house I bought 7 years ago nearby.

Let's fix that.\nBrunch is the star at this Southern comfort restaurant, with excellent items like a tomatillo burrito that we can't eat enough of and chicken and waffles that will do you up just right. Dinner is good too, mostly because many of the best items from earlier in the day are still on the menu. And any place that serves breakfast for dinner is good in our book.\nThe crowd at Devil's Food is typical Wash Park - lots of sun damaged d\u00e9colletages and Lululemon pants with dogs and strollers safely stowed outside. By the way, who are you double-wide stroller people? This sidewalk tyranny cannot stand.\nThankfully, you can avoid all this unnecessary weekend brunch silliness by simply arriving before 10am. Even if you make it early, we wouldn\u2019t recommend going with a group larger than two during the weekend unless you have some time on your hands. There are only a handful of four tops and the dining room is pretty small.\nShould you find the wait to be unbearable, you can always just grab a coffee and some tasty pastries from the bakery table and take them to go. Or you can pass the time outside petting dogs. With this crowd, you can bet they\u2019ve all been through obedience classes."},{"name":"Hops & Pie","cost":3,"address":"\n3920 Tennyson St.\nDenver, CO 80212\n303-477-7000\n","cuisine":"Highlands","review":"What\u2019s the first thing you think of when you hear \u201cartisan pizzeria\u201d and \u201ccraft beer tap room\u201d together in the same sentence? If you said, \u201cthe hipsters\u201d, we\u2019d probably agree with you. In this case, however, those words perfectly describe Hops and Pie - one of the better pizza and beer hangs we\u2019ve seen around Denver. And even though you\u2019re still likely to bump into a few of Denver's finest Brooklynites while you're here, you probably won't mind. Because you'll be face deep in an excellent pizza.\nHighlights from the artisan pizzeria part of Hops focuses around a lot of fresh topping options and a made-from-scratch dough. You'll find a nice variety of snacks, salads, and sandwiches on the menu too, but the pie is where it's at. Keep in mind that all of the toppings will sound good, but don\u2019t f*ck it up trying to kitchen sink your order. Less is more. And if the build-your-own route is too intimidating, a rotating slice-of-the-day, and artisan-pie-of-the-month are there to bail you out. The Tap Room offers 20+ well curated taps and a knowledgeable staff (apparently you can double major in mustache design and craft beer somewhere around here). They\u2019ve managed to bring a nice balance that caters to both beer connoisseurs and common boozers alike. And while craft brew pubs aren\u2019t hard to find in Denver, we\u2019re guessing this place has something worthwhile that you haven\u2019t yet seen or sampled.\nWith ever-changing daily and recurring weekly specials you\u2019ll want to make Hops & Pie part of your regular rotation if you live nearby. Tables can be hard to come by on evenings and weekends, but waiting is actually a worthwhile part of the experience. Take the opportunity to sample some beers, and snoop what's flowing out of the kitchen to get a feel for what\u2019s looking good that night. If we have one complaint, it\u2019d be about the price. A few large pizza\u2019s with toppings can get pretty expensive - but you definitely get what you pay for."},{"name":"Green Russell","cost":3,"address":"\n1422 Larimer St.\nDenver, CO 80202\n303-893-6505\n","cuisine":"Bar Food","review":"Denver is a beer town. That much we know. Just walk into any bar, restaurant, gas station, or day care center, and you'll find about 21 local brews on tap, and probably some more being made on premises. That's been the case since the big \"microbrewery\" boom in the '90s, and it remains true today - even as much of the rest of the country is just now figuring out that Stella Artois is Europe's Old Milwaukee.\nBut as Colorado was soaking up the suds, we were falling behind the fast moving cocktail culture trend, despite companies like Stranahan's making excellent whisky right in our back yard. \"Mixology\" as they call it (we refuse to) became a big business over the last seven years or so, and up until recently, there weren't all that many places in Denver where you could get a quality Old Fashioned, let alone a Sazerac. Green Russell was one of those few places.\nOpened in 2010 by Frank Bonanno and partners, Green Russell is Denver's best and most well-known spot for a quality drink. It's a Prohibition-style speakeasy in the mold of many that came before it, and by that I mean other places exactly like Green Russell that set up shop in cities like New York and Los Angeles around 2005 or so. The formula for all of these \"neo-speakeasies\" is pretty much the same - guests walk down some stairs and arrive at some sort of \"front\" (here it's a pie shop), then speak to a reservationist, eventually being seated after walking through some weird door or something. Cocktails featuring absinthe and molasses ensue.\nWe're always fans of a stiff drink here at The Infatuation, and we like Green Russell a lot. It's always a good place to hang with some friends, even though sometimes it feels a bit steamy down there under the street. But we're not here to just talk about drinks. We're here to talk about food, and Green Russell actually does that pretty well too. There's a solid menu of bar snacks that do a better job of keeping you satiated while you drink high-proof alcohol than they need to, and you can even have a slice of pie if you so choose. We're fans of their loaded potato chips, and pulled pork nachos, and if you want to get down on a full BBQ experience, they've even got an adjacent smokehouse where you can eat ribs with your expensive Manhattan. That one will get its own review at some point. We can only handle one trend at a time per review."},{"name":"Cart-Driver","cost":2,"address":"\n2500 Larimer St.\nDenver, CO 80205\n303-292-3553\n","cuisine":"Pizza","review":"When a menu lists offerings as diffuse as pizza, oysters, and soft serve it\u2019s usually a sign you\u2019re in for a bad meal. It\u2019s also reminiscent of all of the horrible places you ate at in high school that served seafood, turkey melts, and burritos. But needn\u2019t you worry, former-Village-Inn-heads. Cart-Driver\u2019s seemingly random mix of food will make you forget all those late nights spent eating subpar grilled cheese and writing your Riot Grrrl zines.\nNot only is Cart-Driver good, it's surprisingly some of the better pizza you can find in this town. Why is it surprising? Well, because the restaurant is basically an elegant shoebox (okay, it\u2019s a shipping container) with a wood burning oven inside. It's also more of a pizza counter than a restaurant, where you order at the register and hope you can land a table. We've been lucky on most of our visits, and at the very least, the people at Cart-Driver are so nice that you won't mind waiting. Just know that this Ikea model apartment is not for big groups, and that if things get too jammed up, it\u2019s best to take your pie to go.\nDespite - or maybe because of - its diminutive size, Cart-Driver is a great neighborhood hang where you could spend hours drinking too much beer and eating too much pizza. And we\u2019ll never discourage that behavior, especially when the food is this good. This is \u201cfast casual\u201d at its best, or as they call it, \"slow food, fast.\" It's the perfect place to start or end your night, as Cart-Driver is open until midnight daily, with rotating options for pizza, oysters and boozy gelato. Denver keeps getting better all the time."},{"name":"Root Down","cost":3,"address":"\n1600 W. 33rd Ave.\nDenver, CO 80211\n303-993-4200\n","cuisine":"American","review":"Root Down has been serving up seasonal fare since 2008, back when they were really one of the first restaurants to make some noise up here in the Highlands. But things have changed. Long an island onto itself, Root Down has a ton of competition these days. Trendier neighbors like Old Major, Uncle, and Williams & Graham get more shine, but Root Down just keeps puttin\u2019 in work. And we here at The Infatuation are big fans.\nAll the things we love about Root Down have remained the same since they opened. The decor is elegant (for a former gas station), but relaxed. Service is excellent without being stuffy. And the patio is still one of the best in town, featuring great views of downtown. Most importantly, though, the food is always really good. Root Down is now a Denver staple, and regardless of the newer, flashier restaurants that will surely continue to surround it, this restaurant will be a staple for years to come.\nThere are plenty of vegan, vegetarian, and\/or gluten-free options on the menu at Root Down, and while that's much of what they made their name on, you don\u2019t have to be someone who pretends to like the taste of chickpea flour to enjoy a meal here. As a matter of fact, one of the better things here is a $31 short rib, and the cocktails are always strong and creative. Nothing like a stiff drink to wash down a whole sh*tload of brussels sprouts and legumes. And while dinner is the focus, brunch is also an extremely popular and reliable move. The mole breakfast burrito alone is worth a visit. You can even substitute in \"Soyrizo\" if you like, and we might even try that once we know what it is. Then again, no we won't."},{"name":"The Populist","cost":3,"address":"\n3163 Larimer St.\nDenver, CO 80205\n720-432-3163\n","cuisine":"American","review":"Small plates. Community tables. Limited reservations. Closed two days a week.\nIt felt like the Populist made a checklist of things to keep us away. And for\nquite a while, we stayed away. Denver is awash in the played out small plate\nconcept and community tables just make me wanna yell \u201cNo New Friends\u201d. If your\nidea of a nice night out is sharing a bench with people talking about their\nkickball league or how wasted they got last night, more power to you. But this\nisn\u2019t New York - we\u2019ve got plenty of room out here and I don\u2019t need to be up\non some dude\u2019s hip while I eat dinner. On top of all that, the place is only\nopen 25 hours a week.\nEnough complaining though. We come to praise the Populist, not to bury it.\nDespite all advance annoyances, this place is absolutely incredible. The\nconstantly changing menu is diverse and full of strong flavors. And while\nthere are a lot of different cuisines and styles going on, nothing feels out\nof the kitchen\u2019s wheelhouse. You can taste when a restaurant is beyond its\ndepth and there\u2019s no risk of that here.\nThe open-air patio at The Populist feels like a Goop post brought to life.\nWith ivy and strung lights it\u2019s a real oasis and, given its distance from\ndowntown, is largely devoid of traffic noise. You may have to endure copious\nmentions of the words \u201ccraft\u201d and \u201cartisanal\u201d from your neighbors, but the\nscene is pretty great otherwise. We have to give special mention to the\nservice, primarily for the tandoori chicken recommendation.

Get ready for more Celebrity Sports Center and Karl Mecklenburg references. Unfamiliar with those terms? That\u2019s exactly why were\u2019 going to keep it up. You need to get learned on some stuff, person who moved here in the late 2000s. This is a city in which many of the good things are new (including, maybe, you), but the best of it is not.\nTable 6 is most definitely not a new restaurant. This place has operated at 6th Avenue and Corona since 2004, and in Denver restaurant terms, that pretty much makes it The Parthenon. Because of its relative \"senior\" status, Table 6 doesn\u2019t get talked about much anymore. People are too busy talking about ramen, or whatever is happening in RiNo (probably ramen). We\u2019d like to change that, because this a place worth having in your dinner and brunch rotation.\nBased on the fact that it\u2019s old and in Colorado, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised to learn that Table 6 serves \u201cAmerican\u201d food, meaning pork and fish and obviously brussels sprouts. America is nothing if not predictable. The menu here is also highly seasonsal, and that means that things change almost daily. But what we like about Table 6 is how unpredictable it often is. For every duck confit and piece of lamb you'll see here, you'll also often find things like chicken wings and patty melt sliders, all executed on a level appropriate for the environment. What I guess I am trying to say in so many words is that this place serves fancy tater tots and that's awesome.\nThere are other awesome things about Table 6, like the warm room and open kitchen, and the fact that the service is both knowledge and friendly. They also have a great wine list, including a daily special where they showcase a weird\/rare varietal at a good price per glass. It all adds up to a place we like very much, especially due to the fact that they don't take themselves too seriously. There aren't many restaurants that can say that around here, and there aren't many that have been doing it as long as Table 6 has. Chalk one up for the old guys.\nAll photos by Tobin Voggesser for The Infatuation\nDue to the fact that the menu changes so often at Table 6, consider this Food Rundown a visual representation of what might be available."}]
